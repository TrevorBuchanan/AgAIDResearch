## Project progress summary:
* 06/10/2024 - Familiarization with data and begin to parse
* 06/11/2024 - Continue to parse data and begin create visualizations for it
* 06/12/2024 - Expand and refine visualizations and interpolate between missing 
data with multiple techniques depending on the data type (e.i. vi and temperature 
have very different trajectory paths, so the same interpolation cannot be used 
for both. Furthermore, some information can be filled from other IoT units at the 
site, and other online resources such as weather data)
* 06/13/2024 - Refactor and begin to use time series learning models
* 06/14/2024 - Apply uni-variate time series learning models and work on setting 
* effective parameters for best results
* 06/17/2024 - Attempting to refine parameters of LSTM models and adding a stacked LSTM
